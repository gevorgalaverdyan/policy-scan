## About
In this project, we developed a browser extension that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and rate privacy policies. The extension is powered by GroqAI's server-side infrastructure and Metaâ€™s Llama 3 model [2], which works together to provide users with clear evaluations of privacy policies. These evaluations focus on key categories like transparency, data minimization, third-party sharing, and consent mechanisms. This extension was built using React, which made it easier to design a user-friendly interface and display the AI-generated ratings. While the results show the potential of AI to simplify complicated legal language, they also highlight some limitations, such as challenges with text extraction and how the AI interprets the policies. Overall, this project emphasizes the need for tools that make privacy policies easier to understand and more accessible for everyday users.
